# Static-Comp--1 - Luke Finney
* I did my Static Comp on the young comedian (he prefers prodigy) Bo Burnahm.
* Grid-layout was used to organize the various elements on the page. With a grid-layout, one can specificy the squares on a grid that you want a given child element to inhabit if its parent container is set to display: grid.
* Standard page view is for a wide-screen monitor.
* Page breaks occur at 1100px, 800px, with a minor adjustment at 600px.
